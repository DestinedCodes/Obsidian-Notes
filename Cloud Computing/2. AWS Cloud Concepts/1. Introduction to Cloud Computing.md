## Introduction
Cloud computing refers to the delivery of computing services such as storage, servers, databases, software, analytics, and intelligence over the internet ("the cloud"). It has revolutionised the way businesses and individuals store, process, and manage data and applications.

## Major Cloud Service Providers

Some of the major cloud service providers include:

-   Amazon Web Services (AWS)
-   Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
-   Microsoft Azure
-   IBM Cloud

## Cloud Computing Models

### Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)

- IaaS provides access to computing resources such as storage, networking, and servers in the cloud on a pay as you go basis.
- Saves cost by eliminating the need to buy and maintain own hardware
- It is the most flexible of the cloud computing models and can be configured to suit specific needs.
- it requires a skilled DevOps engineer to build and manage the infrastructure from scratch.

### Platform as a Service (PaaS)
- Provides cloud environment to enable development, testing, management and delivery of applications.
- PaaS providers takes care of the underlying operating system, network, security, server software, scaling and backups
- Requires programmers to write applications that work on that platform. It is easier to use than IaaS, but less flexible.
- Developers focuses more on development eliminating underlying infrastructure issues that may arise

### Software as a Service (SaaS)
- SaaS requires no programming skills since the software is already built and can be used directly from the web. Examples of SaaS include email clients and customer relationship management systems.
- Eliminates the need to Install or manage software on local devices
- resources and software can be easily scaled up based on service needs

## Cloud Computing Deployments

### Private Cloud
A private cloud is a deployment model where the cloud infrastructure is located within a company's data center and is not accessible to the public.
- Offers service via the internet or a private network to a selected group of users instead of the general public
- Selected group of users have access to the cloud keeping the cloud private, resulting in higher security and privacy as information is not accessible to third party providers

### Public Cloud


### Hybrid Cloud

A hybrid cloud connects a private cloud to a public cloud, allowing organizations to take advantage of the benefits of both deployments.

### Community Cloud

A community cloud shares private infrastructure among several organizations with common interests, such as regulatory compliance requirements.

## Cloud Computing vs Traditional IT

Traditional IT infrastructure requires capital expenditure, planning, and estimation before purchasing hardware. In contrast, cloud computing offers a pay-as-you-go model with global reach and easy upgradability. However, a trade-off is that clients would need to commit to the changing price of the cloud vendor.

Security is a shared responsibility between the cloud provider and clients. The cloud provider is responsible for the security of the underlying infrastructure, while clients are responsible for securing their data and applications.
