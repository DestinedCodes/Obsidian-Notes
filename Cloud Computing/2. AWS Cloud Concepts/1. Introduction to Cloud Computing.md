Considering an Overview, Advantages and Major players of Cloud Computing, we would also consider, AWS and AWS cloud adoption framework

## Overview of Cloud Computing
For a good overview and advantage of cloud computing, consider [[1. Introduction to Cloud Computing]]

## Cloud Computing Models

### Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)

- IaaS provides access to computing resources such as storage, networking, and servers in the cloud on a pay as you go basis.
- Saves cost by eliminating the need to buy and maintain own hardware
- It is the most flexible of the cloud computing models and can be configured to suit specific needs.
- it requires a skilled DevOps engineer to build and manage the infrastructure from scratch.

### Platform as a Service (PaaS)
- Provides cloud environment to enable development, testing, management and delivery of applications.
- PaaS providers takes care of the underlying operating system, network, security, server software, scaling and backups
- Requires programmers to write applications that work on that platform. It is easier to use than IaaS, but less flexible.
- Developers focuses more on development eliminating underlying infrastructure issues that may arise

### Software as a Service (SaaS)
- SaaS requires no programming skills since the software is already built and can be used directly from the web. Examples of SaaS include email clients and customer relationship management systems.
