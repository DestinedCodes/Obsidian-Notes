## Clouds Computing Models
### Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)

-   IaaS provides access to computing resources such as storage, networking, and serversin the cloud on a pay as you go basis.
-   Saves cost by eliminating the need to buy and maintain own hardware
-   It is the most flexible of the cloud computing models and can be configured to suit specific needs.
-   it requires a skilled DevOps engineer to build and manage the infrastructure from scratch.

### Platform as a Service (PaaS)

-   Provides cloud environment to enable development, testing, management and delivery of applications.
-   PaaS providers takes care of the underlying operating system, network, security, server softwares, scaling and backups
-   Requires programmers to write applications that work on that platform. It is easier to use than IaaS, but less flexible.
-   Developers focuses more on development eliminating underlying infrastructure issues that may arise

### Software as a Service (SaaS)

-   SaaS requires no programming skills since the software is already built and can be used directly from the web. Examples of SaaS include email clients and customer relationship management systems.
