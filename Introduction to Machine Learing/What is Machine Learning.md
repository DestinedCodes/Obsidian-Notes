## Introduction
Machine Learning is responsible for many visible changes we can see around us, it is responsible for:
- Translation of text to multiple languages
- AI assistant we find around us
- Autonomous vehicles
- Workers safety e.t.c.
- AI is the capability of Machine to perform activities with human like intelligence
- Machine learning allows computer to learn and discovered  new patterns from past experience without being programmed to do so.
- Machine learning enable computer to make predictions
- Supervised learning: model is trained on data and the patterns are explained to the model
- unsupervised learning: model is trained on a data but groups the data itself and creates patterns
- reinforcement learning: learns like a dog, it learns from being rewarded for right actions and a penalty for wrong actions.

machine learning combines statistics, computer science and applied maths

## Components of Machine Learning
-   A **model** is an extremely generic program, made specific by the data used to train it.
-   **Model training algorithms** work through an interactive process where the current model iteration is analysed to determine what changes can be made to get closer to the goal. Those changes are made and the iteration continues until the model is evaluated to meet the goals.
-   **Model inference** is when the trained model is used to generate predictions.

## Major Steps in Machine Learning
- Define the Problem
- Build dataset
- Training the model
- Evaluate the model
- Use the model

### Labelled vs Unlabelled data

- **Labelled data:** already contains the solutions - given a data and some information about the data
- **Unlabelled data:** lacks solution or label, means you don't need to provide the model with any kind of label or solution while the model is being trained.
	- Clustering: helps us determine if there are naturally occurring patterns (groupings in the data)

### Types of Label
In supervised learning these are the existing labels:
- **Categorical Label (Classification):**  has a discrete set of possible values, such as "is a cat" and "is not a cat".
- **Continuous Label (Regression):** does not have a discrete set of possible values, which means there are potentially possibly an unlimited number of possibilities.
- and more ...
In Unsupervised learning:
- **Clustering**: A learning task that helps to determine if there are any naturally occurring groupings in the data.
- Deep Learning
